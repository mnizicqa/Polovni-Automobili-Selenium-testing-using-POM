# Polovni Automobili Selenium testing using POM

This is a project which I have done to solidify my Selenium testing framework skill. The goal of the project was to automate [Polovni automobili](https://polovniautomobili.com) website. Tests are written using Selenium framework and Java programming language. As a testing framework I have used TestNG, and tests are organized on the basis of POM (Page Object Model).

As a reporting tool I have used Allure. Project build tool that I have used to streamline project file organization is Maven. Main browser used for running tests was Google Chrome version 125. Tests also work on Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers.

All the dependencies are placed im **pom.xml** file. Just refresh the file when you first open the project, and the dependencies should be loaded and indexed.

To use Allure reporting, open the terminal and enter command **allure serve** and the HTML file with report will be generated.
